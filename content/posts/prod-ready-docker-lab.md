## Infrastructure Overview

My personal lab environment runs on a Linode-managed VM, serving as a Docker host for various containerized applications. Here's the core infrastructure stack:

- **Host Provider**: Linode Docker-managed VM
- **Domain**: looth.io (managed through Porkbun)
- **Container Management**: Portainer
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Architecture Design

The setup implements a GitOps-driven workflow, enabling automatic deployments through Portainer's webhook integration with GitHub. This architecture supports rapid development and deployment of containerized applications.

## Implementation Details

### Development Workflow

1. Local development and testing
2. Containerization with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
3. Code push to GitHub repository
4. Automated deployment via Portainer webhooks

### Deployment Configuration

The deployment process leverages Portainer's stack functionality:

1. Stack configuration points to GitHub repository
2. GitOps functionality enabled in Portainer
3. Webhook URL from Portainer configured in GitHub repository
4. Automatic deployment triggered on every push to the repository

### Why This Setup?

This infrastructure serves as a learning platform for:

- Container orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline implementation
- GitOps practices
- Microservices architecture
- DevOps methodologies

## Future Plans

The environment is designed to support deployment and testing of various web applications and services, providing hands-on experience with:

- Microservices development
- Container orchestration
- Automated deployment workflows
- Infrastructure as Code

## Conclusion

This setup provides a robust foundation for experimenting with modern DevOps practices and containerized application deployment, making it an ideal environment for learning and testing new technologies.
